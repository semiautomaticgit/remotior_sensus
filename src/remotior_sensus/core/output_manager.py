"""Output manager.

Core class that manages several types of output, mainly intended for tools
that have several outputs.

Typical usage example:

    >>> OutputManager()

    """Manages output.

    This class manages several types of output, mainly intended for tools
    that have several outputs.
    Check argument is False if output failed.
    Single output raster or multiple file paths can be defined as arguments.
    Additional output files or tables are managed with an extra argument.
    The type of the extra argument can be flexible depending on the process 
    output.

    Attributes:
        check: True if output is as expected, False if process failed.
        path: path of the first output.
        paths: list of output paths in case of multiple outputs.
        extra: additional output elements depending on the process.

    Examples:
        Output failed
            >>> OutputManager(check=False)
            
        Output is checked and file path is provided
