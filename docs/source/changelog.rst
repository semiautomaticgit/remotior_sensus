Changelog
===============

v0.4.4
________

* Changed raster_zonal_stats to accept raster input as reference_path
* Fixed handling nan value as nodata

v0.4.3
________

* First experimental implementation of Pytorch for band_calc
* Minor fixes

v0.4.2
________

* Minor fixes

v0.4.1
________

* Fixed preprocessing calculation
* Minor fixes

v0.4.0
________

* Added tool "Band clustering" for unsupervised K-means classification of
  bandset
* Added tool "Raster edit" for direct editing of pixel values based on vector
* Added tool "Raster zonal stats" for calculating statistics of a raster
  intersecting a vector.
* Improved the NoData handling for multiprocess calculation
* In "Band clip", "Band dilation", "Band erosion", "Band sieve",
  "Band neighbor", "Band resample" added the option multiple_resolution to
  keep original resolution of individual rasters, or use the resolution of the
  first raster for all the bands
* In "Cross classification" fixed area based accuracy and added kappa hat
  metric
* In "Band combination" added option no_raster_output to avoid the creation of
  output raster, producing only the table of combinations
* In "Band calc" replaced nanpercentile with optimized calculation function
* Improved extraction of ROIs in "Band classification"
* Minor bug fixing and removed Requests dependency
